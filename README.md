# Mathematics is the foundation of modern finance. Pricing models, risk management, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies all rely on #mathematical theory. But mathematics reaches its true power only when it is applied â€” when abstract theorems and concepts are transformed into #models, algorithms, and simulations.


#This repository is dedicated to bridging that gap. It is a collection of implementations that take concepts from advanced mathematics and quantitative finance texts, and translate them into code, algorithms, and computational methods.
